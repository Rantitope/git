# Git Assignment

In this assignment, you will be learning more about `git` and `GitHub` by working through the questions. As you answer the questions, you will practice your git skills by staging, committing and pushing your answers (changes) along the way.

1. Create a new public repository called `git_assignment` without a `README.md`
2. Clone it to your local computer
3. Create a `README.md` and paste the following code inside:

    ```markdown
    # Git Assignment - <Your GitHub Username>
    ```

4. Stage, commit and push the repo
5. Create a new branch called `assignment`
6. In your `README.md`, answer the following questions:
    
    > a. What is an _issue_?
    An issue is a way to track tasks, enhancements, or bugs in a project. It allows collaborators to discuss, assign, and prioritize work. Issues can be created and managed on platforms like GitHub to facilitate project management.
    > b. What is a _pull request_?
    > A pull request is a method of submitting contributions to a project. It allows a developer to notify project maintainers about changes they want to merge into the main codebase. Pull requests facilitate code review, discussion, and integration of changes

    > c. Describe the steps to open a _pull request_?
    > Fork or clone the repository: Make a copy of the repository to your own GitHub account.
        Create a new branch: Use a descriptive name for your branch (e.g., feature/new-feature).
        Make your changes: Edit the code, add files, and commit your changes.
        Push your changes: Push your branch to the remote repository on GitHub.
        Open a pull request: Go to the original repository, click on "Pull Requests," then "New Pull Request." Select your branch and follow the prompts to create the PR, including a title and description.
        Submit the pull request: Review your changes and submit the PR for review.

    
    > d. Describe the steps to add a collaborator to a repository (share write permissions)
       Go to the repository on GitHub: Navigate to the repository where you want to add a collaborator.
    Access the Settings: Click on the "Settings" tab at the top of the repository.
    Select "Manage access": On the left sidebar, find and click on "Manage access."
    Invite a collaborator: Click on the "Invite teams or people" button, enter the GitHub username or email of the collaborator, and select their access level (e.g., Write).
    Send the invitation: Confirm the invitation, and the collaborator will receive a notification to accept.

    > e. What is the difference between `git` and `GitHub`?
    > Git is a version control system that tracks changes in code. It allows developers to manage their source code history locally while GitHub is a web-based platform that hosts Git repositories and provides         collaboration tools. It facilitates sharing code, managing projects, and reviewing changes.


    > f. What does `git diff` do?
    >  git diff shows the differences between various states of your repository. It can display changes between the working directory and the index (staged changes), between the index and the last commit, or between any two commits.

    > g. What is the `main` branch?
    > The main branch is the default branch in a Git repository where the stable, production-ready code is maintained. It serves as the primary line of development and is typically where merges from feature branches are integrated.

    > h. Besides our initial commit if it is a new repository, should we directly push our changes directly into the `main` branch?
    > No, one can create feature branches for new work and use pull requests to merge changes after review. This helps maintain code quality and reduces the risk of introducing errors into the main branch.
    

Feel free to at any point (recommended after answering every 2 questions) to stage, commit and push your work to GitHub. It is a great way to practice using `git`!

1. When you are done, please stage, commit your changes, and push it to GitHub.
2. Open up a pull request.
3. Write down in your pull request what you learned from this assignment. ([Guidelines for Pull Request Descriptions](https://github.com/UofT-DSI/onboarding/blob/main/onboarding_documents/submissions.md#guidelines-for-pull-request-descriptions))
